The file "Tutorial_single_stage.Rmd" is a quick tutorial to demonstrate how to implement the covariate functional balancing learning (CFBL) and the augmented covariate functional balancing learning (ACFBL) approaches proposed by ‘Robust estimation of optimal dynamic treatment regimes with nonignorable missing covariates’ in the single-stage scenario.

The file "Tutorial_multiple_stage.Rmd" is a quick tutorial to demonstrate how to implement the augmented covariate functional balancing learning (ACFBL) approaches proposed by ‘Robust estimation of optimal dynamic treatment regimes with nonignorable missing covariates’ in the multiple-stage scenario.
